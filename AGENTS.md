- Project is work-in-progress, implements Haskell developer tooling.
- Contains a general purpose embedded build system / incremental computation
  system, supporting dynamic/monadic dependencies, early cutoff, cached
  artifacts, etc. Equivalent in power to Buck2 (in a theoretical, Build Systems
  à la Carte sense).
- Compile with `cabal build`.
- Run tests with `cabal test`.
